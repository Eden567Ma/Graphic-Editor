# Graphic Editor 

### 


Develop a vector graphics editor, modeled after Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape. Of course, our editor will have only a very limited number of features. We compensate for this by emphasizing an extensible design, allowing for easy addition of features. The editor's design will be based on principles of delegation, programming to interfaces, and the use of some design patterns. For the graphical user interface (GUI), I have used the JavaFX API.


Objectifs :
* Develop a graphical interface with the JavaFX API.
* Develop an extensible application architecture.
* Implement the delegation principle.
* Implement observer, composite, singleton, command, and strategy design patterns.



Continuous integration runs the .gitlab-ci.yml script, which specifies the list of unit test classes.
